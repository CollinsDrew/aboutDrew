  <h1 id="title">About Me</h1>

  <p class="content">My name is Drew Matthew Collins, im 32 and was born and raised in Norwich. I live in a suburb of Norwich called Sprowston with my fiance Emily, and our douge de borduex, Wesley. My hobbies include watching football, i have a season ticket at Norwich City FC, gaming (mainly playing the Final Fantasy franchise), socialising with friends and family, and travelling.</p>

  <h2 id="subtitle">Education History</h2>

  <p class="content">My education started at the age of 4 where i attended Sprowston first school, later progressing to Sprowston middle, then Sprowston high school. After high school, i completed 1 year of sixth form at 'Kett sixth form'
  I then started my apprentiship in 'Groundworks and Civil engineering, and a year in to the apprentiship, I attended Bircham Newton Construction college'.
  In June of 2022, I started the Tech Educators full stack software development bootcamp, that is ongoing today. </p>

  <h3 id="sub">Job Experience</h3>

  <p class="content">My first job was actually as a site labourer for the summer. Duties included sweeping out newly built houses, stacking bricks and blocks, mixing concrete and mortar, finding and fetching anything that the tradesmen needed.
  I then started my apprentiship in Groundworks and Civil engineering for a firm called 'Batemans'. I completed the 3 year apprentiship but was then unfortuntly made redundant soon after due to the reccession of 2008.
  As construction work was hard to come by during this time, i got a job in a call centre for a few months. 'Insight' was a charitable fun raisimg company, supporting many charities that helped people with heart disease, cancer, hearing problems and dementia.
  Shortly after leaving 'Insight', I had a short stint at 'Anglian Home Improvements' selling renovation projects to customers.
    At the age of 21, I got my job back at Batemans, where I then got my digger drivers licence. I stayed at Batemans for another 3 years.
    I left Batemans to become a sub contractor for 'Clarets Civil Engineering' but unfortunatly only stayed for 7 months, as they lost their main contract, resulting in the firm letting go of all sub contractors.
    I then briefly worked for 'Modular works' before starting my own small business called 'Precision Home Improvements'. In this buisness, we carried out all home renovation works from landscaping, kitchen/bathroom fitting, to extentions.
    I left my small business in 2019 to go back to digger driving at a small groumdworks firm called 'KEO contractors', where i am currently working today.
  </p>

  <h3 id="all">Goals</h4>

  <p class="content">Currently, my goals are to complete the Tech Eductors full stack bootcamp, and persue a career in coding and software development.</p>
