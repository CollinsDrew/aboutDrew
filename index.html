  <h3 id="sub">Job Experience</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>My first job was actually as a site labourer for the summer. Duties included sweeping out newly built houses, stacking bricks and blocks, mixing concrete and mortar, finding and fetching anything that the tradesmen needed.</li>
  <li>I then started my apprentiship in Groundworks and Civil engineering for a firm called 'Batemans'. I completed the 3 year apprentiship but was then unfortuntly made redundant soon after due to the reccession of 2008.</li>
  <li>As construction work was hard to come by during this time, i got a job in a call centre for a few months. 'Insight' was a charitable fun raisimg company, supporting many charities that helped people with heart disease, cancer, hearing problems and dementia.</li>
  <li>Shortly after leaving 'Insight', I had a short stint at 'Anglian Home Improvements' selling renovation projects to customers.</li>
    <li>At the age of 21, I got my job back at Batemans, where I then got my digger drivers licence. I stayed at Batemans for another 3 years.</li>
    <li>I left Batemans to become a sub contractor for 'Clarets Civil Engineering' but unfortunatly only stayed for 7 months, as they lost their main contract, resulting in the firm letting go of all sub contractors.</li>
    <li>I then briefly worked for 'Modular works' before starting my own small business called 'Precision Home Improvements'. In this buisness, we carried out all home renovation works from landscaping, kitchen/bathroom fitting, to extentions.</li>
    <li>I left my small business in 2019 to go back to digger driving at a small groundworks firm called 'KEO contractors', where I am currently working today.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="all">Goals</h4>

  <p>Currently, my goals are to complete the Tech Eductors full stack bootcamp, and persue a career in coding and software development.</p>
